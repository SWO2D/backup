## Solidity EVM CTF

Two CTFs are included here:

- NFT Marketplace
- Shellboxes Token

Both CTFs contain multiple critical vulnerabilities that were found in live projects. 

In order to apply for a Solidity position, **both challenges should be completed.**

**We do not want a report that is full of low/informational issues such as missing zero address checks or floating pragmas.
We are looking for engineers who can fully understand the purpose of these contracts and can find all critical/high issues in them.**

Most Shellboxes engineers use the Brownie IDE for manual testing. We would really value any critical/high finding that also have a Brownie script attached as a Proof of Concept to reproduce the issue.

**Hint**: Each CTF contains at least 3 different critical issues.
